# BeerPongSimulator
Neural Network that plays virtual Beer Pong and learns by Genetic Algorithms.

## How to run:
The main file that creates random Neural Networks and trains them by using a Genetic Algorithm is *beerpong.m*.
To see a match in action, use the function *beerpongMatch(neuralNetwork1,neuralNetwork2,maxShotsPerPlayer,true)*.
